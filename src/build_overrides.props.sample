		This file is used to control the platforms compiled by visual studio, and 
      		allow for a faster build when testing for a single platform.
    
    		Instructions:
			1) Copy this file and remove the ".sample" name
			2) Adjust the BuildTargetFramework property below, there can only be one.
			3) Make sure to do a Rebuild, so that nuget restores the proper packages for the new target
